# PixelPioneer Project
We are a small project of CodeLively, where different artists publish their pixel images. Our goal is to give everyone on the internet the possibility to use our images. Also publicly.
<br>
Anyone may download these resources completely free of charge, and use them commercially. Please note, however, that in the event of a copyright claim, we assume no responsibility.
